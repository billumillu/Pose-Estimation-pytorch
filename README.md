# Pose Estimation | pytorch
I used a custom pre-trained model (slightly modified VGG-19). It was trained on the COCO dataset (250,000 people with keypoints - 42.7GB!).

My goal for this project was to get a simple model that will give me the pose for a human body. I plan to later use this in another project. The idea is to classify people based on their pose into - attackers, victims. This could help in preventing/controlling crimes. I currently need to learn about video analytics, and collect data (crime videos) for this project. Then, I will integrate it with this model.
